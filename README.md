### Setup on your machine

If you are on Linux/Wsl, all you have to do is to set the enviroment variables then open the terminal and type:

```shell
$ make build_dev
$ make restore_dev
```

Now your app should be running on localhost:8080

For other OS users, it may be not enough and you may have a bit more work. I can not give support at the moment.
